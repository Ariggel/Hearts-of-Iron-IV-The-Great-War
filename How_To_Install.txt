Hearts of Iron IV: The Great War
--------------------------------

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

The folder that stores mods for the game is:

   >>> Windows: ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\

   >>> Linux: ~/.paradoxinteractive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/ or ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/

   >>> Mac: ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/


Manually downloaded mods should include a .mod file along with a folder.
If so, the files can simply be dropped into the mod file.
If one is downloading a newer version of a mod they already have installed, one should remove the older files first.
