 heavy_tank_chassis_0_desc:0 "The development of tanks in World War I was a response to the stalemate that developed on the Western Front. Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties that stimulated development."

This small tank is piloted by two men, a driver and a tank commander operating the 37 mm gun and the Hotchkiss machine gun. Mobile and agile, protected by 16 mm of armour, its cost-effectiveness ratio is the best of its kind."

The Schneider was inspired by the need to overcome the stalemate of trench warfare which on the Western Front prevailed during most of the Great War. It was designed specifically to open passages for the infantry through barbed wire and then to suppress German machine gun nests."
